The final project allows students to explore methods beyond the course scope and contribute to the course knowledge base. Students select a hydroclimate risk problem and either apply a familiar method to a new context or learn and apply a new method.

## Three-Deliverable Approach

### Lecture Notes Contribution

Add a subsection to the course materials explaining your chosen method:

- Mathematical framework and key assumptions
- Implementation guidance with code examples
- Discussion of strengths, limitations, and appropriate applications
- Integration with course themes (uncertainty quantification, model evaluation, etc.)

### Teaching Segment (15-20 minutes)

Present your method to the class during the Student Teaching Sessions:

- Demonstrate the method with a concrete example
- Explain when and why to use this approach
- Connect to course concepts and other methods
- Facilitate discussion about applications and limitations

### Research Proposal (10 pages)

Develop a research proposal showing how your method could address a significant hydroclimate risk problem:

- Problem motivation and significance
- Literature review positioning your approach
- Detailed methodology and implementation plan
- Expected outcomes and broader impacts
- Timeline and resource requirements

## Timeline

- **Project Introduction**: August 27 (assigned with course introduction)
- **Half-Page Proposal Due**: October 15 (after Module 1 exam feedback - method and problem identification)
- **Mandatory Check-ins**: October 13-17 (schedule one-on-one meeting to discuss proposal and scope)
- **Final Deliverables Due**: December 5 (lecture notes contribution, research proposal)
- **Student Teaching Sessions**: December 1, December 3, December 5 (15-20 minute teaching presentations)

**Note**: The proposal and check-in system ensures appropriate topic selection and scope before significant work begins. Topics that are too simple or too ambitious will be identified and adjusted early in the process.
