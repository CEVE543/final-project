The field of hydroclimate risk assessment draws from a vast array of statistical and machine learning techniques.
While this course covers foundational methods, many specialized approaches remain unexplored.
This project provides an opportunity to independently investigate a method not covered in class while contributing to the collective learning experience through teaching and knowledge sharing.

## Topic Selection

Choose a specific statistical or machine learning method relevant to hydroclimate applications.
Your topic should be suitable for a focused 20-minute class presentation and should emphasize methodological understanding rather than broad application surveys.

### Suggested Topics

Consider these examples, each offering multiple possible approaches depending on your interests:

- Diffusion models: either a general methodological overview or application to synthetic weather generation for extreme events
- Gaussian processes
- Spectral analysis
- Weather typing

### Scope Considerations

Note that topics vary significantly in breadth.
Some methods like diffusion models represent entire research domains, while others like weather typing are more narrowly defined techniques.
Regardless of your chosen topic's inherent scope, focus your exploration on specific implementations and applications rather than attempting comprehensive coverage.

Base your work on **two primary sources** (research papers or textbooks) that provide both theoretical foundation and practical guidance.
When multiple implementation approaches exist, acknowledge this diversity but concentrate your detailed analysis on a single, well-documented example.

## Deliverables

### Lecture Notes (30 points)

Contribute a new subsection to the course [textbook](https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/climate-risk-management-reference/) that explains your chosen method.
Your contribution should follow the existing structure and style of current chapters.

Your textbook contribution needs to cover three key areas.
First, present the mathematical framework with clear notation and explicitly state key assumptions.
Second, offer critical evaluation by discussing the method's strengths, limitations, and appropriate use cases.
Finally, integrate your method with course themes by connecting it to concepts like uncertainty quantification, model evaluation, and risk assessment that we've covered throughout the semester.

### Teaching Segment (30 points)

Deliver a 20-minute instructional presentation during the Student Teaching Sessions, focusing on active learning rather than passive information transfer.
Use traditional teaching tools like chalkboard or whiteboard rather than prepared slides to encourage dynamic, responsive instruction.

Your presentation should work through a concrete example that illustrates the method's practical application.
Clearly explain when, why, and how to use this approach, making explicit connections to techniques and concepts we've previously covered in class.
Most importantly, facilitate meaningful discussion with your classmates about the method's applications, limitations, and potential extensions.

### Research Proposal (40 points)

Develop a comprehensive research proposal demonstrating how your method could address a significant hydroclimate risk challenge.
Structure your proposal as a competitive grant application following standard academic format with appropriate citations and professional presentation.
The 5-page limit applies to the main body of the proposal (introduction, literature review, methodology, expected outcomes, and timeline) and does not include references or appendices.

You may assume that the reader has read your lecture notes, so avoid redundant explanations of the method itself.

Begin by motivating a specific hydroclimate risk problem you want to address and explaining its broader significance to society and the scientific community.
Conduct a thorough literature review that positions your proposed approach within existing research and clearly identifies knowledge gaps that your work would fill.
Present detailed methodology including specific implementation plans, data requirements, computational approaches, and validation strategies you would use.
Describe your expected outcomes and explain their potential impact on the field of hydroclimate risk assessment.
Finally, provide a realistic project timeline with clear milestones and resource requirements spanning a 2-3 year research period.

## Timeline and Milestones

The project unfolds over the full semester with structured checkpoints to ensure steady progress and timely feedback.

- **Project Introduction**: August 27 — Project assigned with course introduction and initial topic brainstorming
- **Mandatory Individual Meetings**: October 13-17 — Schedule required one-on-one consultation to refine project scope and discuss implementation strategy
- **Topic Proposal Due**: 24 hours before your scheduled meeting — Submit half-page proposal identifying your chosen method and target hydroclimate problem to allow time for review prior to meeting
- **Final Written Deliverables Due**: December 5 — Submit completed lecture notes contribution and research proposal
- **Student Teaching Sessions**: December 1, 3, and 5 — Deliver 20-minute teaching presentations to the class

*Timeline subject to adjustment based on course progression and enrollment.*
