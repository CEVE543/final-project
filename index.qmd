The field of hydroclimate risk assessment draws from a vast array of statistical and machine learning techniques.
While this course covers foundational methods, many specialized approaches remain unexplored.
This project provides an opportunity to independently investigate a method not covered in class while contributing to the collective learning experience through teaching and knowledge sharing.

## Topic Selection

Choose a specific statistical or machine learning **method** that you want to learn about and that is relevant to hydroclimate applications.
Your focus must be on understanding and teaching the method itself—how it works, when to use it, its assumptions, and its limitations.

**Important**: Your presentation and lecture notes should teach the **method**, not just present an application.
While you should illustrate the method with concrete examples and discuss potential applications in your research proposal, the core content must explain the methodological approach itself.
This is not a literature review or case study presentation—it is a methods tutorial that enables your classmates to understand and potentially use the technique.

### Suggested Topics

Consider these examples, ranging from more accessible methods to advanced techniques:

**Foundational Methods** (good for students building core statistical skills):

- Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope estimator for detecting trends in hydrologic time series
- Bootstrap methods for uncertainty quantification in hydrologic applications
- Kernel density estimation for rainfall analysis
- Copulas for modeling dependence between hydrologic variables

**Intermediate Methods** (suitable for students with solid statistics background):

- Spectral analysis and wavelet decomposition for identifying periodicities in climate data
- Weather typing and circulation pattern classification
- Time series decomposition methods (STL, seasonal-trend decomposition)
- Spatial interpolation methods (kriging, thin plate splines)

**Advanced Methods** (for students with strong ML/stats background):

- Gaussian processes for spatial-temporal modeling
- Diffusion models for synthetic weather generation
- Variational inference methods for Bayesian hydrologic models
- Deep learning architectures for precipitation downscaling

### Scope Considerations

Note that topics vary significantly in breadth.
Some methods like diffusion models represent entire research domains, while others like weather typing are more narrowly defined techniques.
Regardless of your chosen topic's inherent scope, focus your exploration on specific implementations and applications rather than attempting comprehensive coverage.

Base your work on **two primary sources** (research papers or textbooks) that provide both theoretical foundation and practical guidance.
When multiple implementation approaches exist, acknowledge this diversity but concentrate your detailed analysis on a single, well-documented example.

## Deliverables

### Lecture Notes (40 points)

Contribute a new subsection to the course [textbook](https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/climate-risk-management-reference/) that explains your chosen method.
Your contribution should follow the existing structure and style of current chapters.

Your textbook contribution needs to cover these key areas:

- Present the mathematical framework with clear notation and explicitly state key assumptions
- Work through at least one concrete example demonstrating the method's application to hydroclimate problems
- Provide critical evaluation by discussing the method's strengths, limitations, and appropriate use cases
- Integrate your method with course themes by connecting it to concepts like uncertainty quantification, model evaluation, and risk assessment that we've covered throughout the semester
- Include properly formatted citations to your primary sources and other relevant literature

### Teaching Segment (60 points)

Deliver a 20-minute instructional presentation during the Student Teaching Sessions, focusing on active learning rather than passive information transfer.
Use traditional teaching tools like chalkboard or whiteboard rather than prepared slides to encourage dynamic, responsive instruction.

Your presentation should work through a concrete example that illustrates the method's practical application.
Clearly explain when, why, and how to use this approach, making explicit connections to techniques and concepts we've previously covered in class.
Most importantly, facilitate meaningful discussion with your classmates about the method's applications, limitations, and potential extensions.

## Timeline and Milestones

The project unfolds over the full semester with structured checkpoints to ensure steady progress and timely feedback.

- **Project Introduction**: August 25 — Project assigned with course introduction
- **In-Class Workshop**: October 8 — Dedicated class time for topic selection and initial planning
- **Topic Proposal Due**: October 15 — Submit one-page proposal identifying your chosen method and two primary sources
- **Mandatory Individual Meetings**: October 17-24 — Schedule required one-on-one consultation to refine project scope and discuss implementation strategy
- **Draft Lecture Notes Due**: November 14 — Submit complete draft of textbook contribution for formative feedback
- **Final Lecture Notes Due**: November 28 — Submit completed lecture notes contribution to use in teaching preparation
- **Student Teaching Sessions**: December 1, 3, and 5 — Deliver 20-minute teaching presentations to the class

*Timeline subject to adjustment based on course progression and enrollment.*

## Draft Deliverable Expectations

### Topic Proposal (October 15)

Submit a one-page document that includes:

- Your chosen method with brief justification for why it interests you
- Two primary sources (research papers or textbook chapters) that provide both theoretical foundation and practical implementation guidance
- Brief statement of how this method connects to course concepts

### Draft Lecture Notes (November 14)

Submit a complete draft of your textbook contribution that includes:

- Mathematical framework with proper notation and stated assumptions
- At least one worked example demonstrating the method's application
- Initial discussion of strengths, limitations, and appropriate use cases
- Draft connections to course themes (uncertainty quantification, model evaluation, risk assessment)

This draft should be substantively complete, though it may benefit from refinement based on feedback.
The goal is to provide you with formative feedback before your teaching session.
